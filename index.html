      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p>
        I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many
        things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like
        to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to
        listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the
        moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like
        to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in
        the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot
        sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in
        summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I
        like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by
        people. I like countryâ€™s peace,
      </p>
